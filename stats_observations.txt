Statistical Observations

1. The categorical data is not suitable for statistical analysis, in this dataframe, that is Seasons, Holiday and Functioning Day.
2. In order to use this data in statistical analysis, it cold be changed to boolean values in new columns (encoded) using pd.get_dummies function.
3. There is also manual mapping where the key value pairs are defined in a dictionary. i.e. season_mapping = {'Winter': 1, 'Spring': 2, 'Summer': 3, 'Fall': 4}
   Then create a new column df['Season_encoded'] = df['Seasons'].map.  Now each season is a number in a new column.
4. Also sklearn has the LabelEncoder() function to work statistically with categorical data.
5. In the steps assigned above, the visibility was normalized so that the highest value is 1 and the lowest is 0.
6. Temperature was multiplied by 10 as the assignment required.
7. The column "hour" I originally thought was hours the bikes were rented, but then realized since it was 24 numbers, it was actually describing the hour of the day that the bike was rented.
8. So it was not really quantitative and could be considered and used as categorical data.  I considered changing the format but did not.
